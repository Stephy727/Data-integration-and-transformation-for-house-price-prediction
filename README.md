# Data-integration-and-transformation-for-house-price-prediction

Various data sources have been integrated to make an nalytical dataset for house price prediction for houses.

The files used are:
vic_suburb_boundary.zip,
gtfs.zip
Crimebylocation.xlsx
base.csv
council.txt

Also different transformation techniques such as i.e.
standardization, min-max normalization, log, power, and root transformation on Rooms ,
crime_C_average, travel_min_to_CBD , and property_age attributes have been tested. The effects have been observed
to build a linear model on price using these attributes as the predictors of the linear model.
When building the linear model, the same normalization/transformation
method has been applied to each of these attributes.
